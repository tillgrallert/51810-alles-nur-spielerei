  {"id":"Bunge1963GeneralBlackBox","abstract":"A mathematical theory is proposed and exemplified, which covers an extended class of black boxes. Every kind of stimulus and response is pictured by a channel connecting the box with its environment. The input-output relation is given by a postulate schema according to which the response is, in general, a nonlinear functional of the input. Several examples are worked out: the perfectly transmitting box, the damping box, and the amplifying box. The theory is shown to be (\n              a\n              ) an extension of the\n              S\n              -matrix theory and the accompanying channel picture as developed in microphysics; (\n              b\n              ) abstract and applicable to any problem involving the transactions of a system (physical, biological, social, etc.) with its milieu; (\n              c\n              ) superficial, because unconcerned with either the structure of the box or the nature of the stimuli and responses. The motive for building the theory was to show the capabilities and limitations of the phenomenological approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunge","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"Bunge1963GeneralBlackBox","container-title":"Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Philos. of Sci.","DOI":"10.1086/287954","ISSN":"0031-8248, 1539-767X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1963,10]]},"language":"en","page":"346-358","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A General Black Box Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0031824800040150/type/journal_article","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"Jacob2021PunchingHoles","abstract":"In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes that by examining the process of history we can “discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.” Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities examines the process of history in the narrative of the digital humanities and deconstructs its history as a straight line from the beginnings of humanities computing. By discussing alternatives histories of the digital humanities that address queer gaming, feminist game studies praxis, Cold War military-industrial complex computation, the creation of the environmental humanities, monolingual discontent in DH, the hidden history of DH in English studies, radical media praxis, cultural studies and DH, indigenous futurities, Pacific Rim postcolonial DH, the issue of scale and DH, the radical, indigenous, feminist histories of the digital database, and the possibilities for an antifascist DH, this collection hopes to re-set discussions of the straight, white origin myths of DH. Thus, this collection hopes to reexamine the silences in such a straight and white masculinist history and delineates how power comes into play to shape this straight, white DH narrative.  A number of the pieces in this volume go back to the origin myth of the digital humanities to reassess the hagiography of Father Busa by reconsidering and recontextualizing his legacy and his work in relation to media archaeology, politics, Cold War maneuvers, mechanized genocide, the Third Reich, and the military-industrial complex as it has organized various fields, including Asian Studies. This reassessment of comparative genealogies — vis-à-vis Foucault — undergirds an alternative history of the Jesuit hagiography we have so far been unwilling to reexamine for its narrative use in embellishing an origin hagiography/historiography for digital humanities. Other pieces intertwine the digital humanities with other fields — area studies, Asian American Studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and environmental studies — in order to reexamine how the intersections and juxtapositions reveal silences in these histories. And finally, a number of pieces considers alternative praxes in rethinking these histories, whether it is an essay that is a game or a reevaluation of feminist media praxis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacob","given":"Arun"}],"citation-key":"Jacob2021PunchingHoles","container-title":"Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities","DOI":"10.53288/0274.1.00","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Adeline"}],"event-place":"Earth","ISBN":"978-1-953035-58-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-SA-NC 4.0","page":"121-145","publisher":"punctum books","publisher-place":"Earth","title":"Punching Holes in the International Busa Machine Narrative","title-short":"Punching Holes","type":"chapter","URL":"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/alternative-histories-of-the-digital-humanities/"},

  {"id":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","abstract":"Data and its technologies now play a large and growing role in humanities research and teaching. This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"},{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"}],"citation-key":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","collection-title":"Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities","container-title":"The Shape of Data in Digital Humanities: Modeling Texts and Text-based Resources","editor":[{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-367-58403-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"26-95","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","title":"A gentle introduction to data modeling","type":"chapter"},
