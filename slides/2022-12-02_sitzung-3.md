## DH are many things to many people

- a misnomer: who speaks of "digital physics"?
- a label: symbolic capital
- methodological approaches: result in community/ies of practice
- a discipline: with its own history and institutional structures

# 1. DH as label
## DH as label

>it is largely due  to the apparently instrumental or utilitarian value of the digital humanities (their ability to provide liberal arts majors with digital skills that can  be turned into productive jobs) that university administrators, foundation  officers, and government agencies have been so eager to fund DH projects,  create DH undergraduate and graduate programs, and hire DH faculty.

<cite>Grusin, *The Dark Side of Digital Humanities*, 2014</cite>

# DH as methodological approaches
## DH as methodological approaches

>DH is the application of computational tools to research questions rooted in the humanities and the scrutiny of computational tools and digital media with methodologies rooted in the humanities.

<cite>My own working definition</cite>

>What is important today is not that we are doing work with computers, but rather that we are doing the work of the humanities, in digital form. The field is now much broader than it once was, and includes not only the computational modeling and analysis of humanities information, but also the cultural study of digital technologies, their creative possibilities, and their social impact.

<cite>Schreibmann, Siemens, and Unsworth, *A New Companion to Digital Humanities*, 2016</cite>

## DH as methodological approaches

>[...] there are central concerns among digital humanists which cross disciplinary boundaries. This is nowhere more evident than in the representation of knowledge-bearing artifacts. The process of such representation – especially so when done with the attention to detail and the consistency demanded by the computing environment – requires humanists to make explicit what they know about their material and to understand the ways in which that material exceeds or escapes representation. [...]

>The process that one goes through in order to develop, apply, and compute these knowledge representations is unlike anything that humanities scholars, outside of philosophy, have ever been required to do. This method, or perhaps we should call it a heuristic, discovers a new horizon for humanities scholarship, a paradigm as powerful as any that has arisen in any humanities discipline in the past – and, indeed, maybe more powerful, because the rigor it requires will bring to our attention undocumented features of our own ideation. Coupled with enormous storage capacity and computational power, this heuristic presents us with patterns and connections in the human record that we would never otherwise have found or examined.

<cite>Schreibmann, Siemens, and Unsworth, *A Companion to Digital Humanities*, 2004</cite>

## DH as a community

>For us, digital humanities simply represents a community of scholars and teachers interested in using or studying technology. We use humanities techniques to study digital cultures, tools, and concepts, and we also use computational methods to explore the traditional objects of humanistic inquiry.

<cite>Battershill and Ross, *Using Digital Humanities in the Classroom*, 2017</cite>

    + IBM card indexes
- 1960s: conferences and journals as nucleus for a field
    + availability of software packages: SPSS (1968), TU-STEP
- 1970s: scholarly associations
    + formation of first independent discipline: comp.ling.
- 1980s onwards: digital editing, corpus building
    + databases, personal computers, word processors
    + TEI (1987)
- 1990s: www, internet
- 2000s onwards: digital humanities as term and discipline
    + adoption of methods as standards by funding bodies
- 2010s: expanding from textual media
