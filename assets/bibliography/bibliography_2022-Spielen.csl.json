  {"id":"Bunge1963GeneralBlackBox","abstract":"A mathematical theory is proposed and exemplified, which covers an extended class of black boxes. Every kind of stimulus and response is pictured by a channel connecting the box with its environment. The input-output relation is given by a postulate schema according to which the response is, in general, a nonlinear functional of the input. Several examples are worked out: the perfectly transmitting box, the damping box, and the amplifying box. The theory is shown to be (\n              a\n              ) an extension of the\n              S\n              -matrix theory and the accompanying channel picture as developed in microphysics; (\n              b\n              ) abstract and applicable to any problem involving the transactions of a system (physical, biological, social, etc.) with its milieu; (\n              c\n              ) superficial, because unconcerned with either the structure of the box or the nature of the stimuli and responses. The motive for building the theory was to show the capabilities and limitations of the phenomenological approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunge","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"Bunge1963GeneralBlackBox","container-title":"Philosophy of Science","container-title-short":"Philos. of Sci.","DOI":"10.1086/287954","ISSN":"0031-8248, 1539-767X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1963,10]]},"language":"en","page":"346-358","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A General Black Box Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0031824800040150/type/journal_article","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","abstract":"Data and its technologies now play a large and growing role in humanities research and teaching. This book addresses the needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"},{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"}],"citation-key":"JannidisFlanders2019GentleIntroduction","collection-title":"Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities","container-title":"The Shape of Data in Digital Humanities: Modeling Texts and Text-based Resources","editor":[{"family":"Flanders","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Jannidis","given":"Fotis"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-367-58403-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"26-95","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","title":"A gentle introduction to data modeling","type":"chapter"},
